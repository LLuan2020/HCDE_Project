# Introducation

The Coronavirus pandemic has pushed medical resources to the limit and caused many small businesses, such as restaurants, salons, and fitness centers to close. This report analyzes the pandemicâ€™s impact on unemployment rates in Pima County, Arizona and provides valuable information to policymakers. It examines unemployment rates from 2014 to 2021 and then shows how unemployment rates have varied monthly since the pandemic began. It also compares unemployment rates before and after the beginning of the pandemic. Then, it examines the relationship between new infection cases and unemployment rates. The final portion of the analysis shows whether mask mandates will slow down the spread of COVID-19.


# Hypothesis

- The COVID-19 pandemic severely affects the unemployment rate.
- The unemployment rate is positively correlated with the number of COVID-19 cases.
- Mask mandates will slow down the spread of COVID-19.


# Analytical Methods

The methodology used in this analysis is data visualization and hypothesis testing. To verify the first hypothesis, a time series plot with unemployment rates was created to determine whether unemployment rates have varied since the pandemic began in Pima County. The unemployment rates were plotted on a month-by-month basis for different years to see whether there was a difference between unemployment rates before and after the beginning of the pandemic in Pima County. Then, hypothesis testing was applied to determine whether a statistically significant difference exists for unemployment rates before and after the beginning of the pandemic. This report then analyzes data and creates visualizations. The trend analysis compares new cases numbers to unemployment rates. A scatter plot is used to conclude whether there are any linear correlations between new infection numbers and unemployment rates. Since new case numbers are provided daily and influenced by the different days in a week, the COVID-19 cases and unemployment rates were compared by averaging the numbers on a monthly level. These methods possibly remove the impact of the different days in a week and instead focus on human-centered perspectives.
